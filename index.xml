Back in the halcyon days of March 2020, the first WFH orders came down and I thought to myself &amp;ldquo;okay, I&amp;rsquo;d better get some stuff to make this setup a little more bearable&amp;rdquo;. At the time I was working at Alto Pharmacy, and my desk setup was pretty nice in the office; I had two monitors, keyboard, and a mouse at home to use with my personal desktop, but I was tired of fumbling cables at the beginning and end of every work day.</description></item><item><title>On Writing</title><link>https://alextoombs.co/posts/on-writing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 13:17:15 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://alextoombs.co/posts/on-writing/</guid><description>On Writing Writing has always been something aspirational for me.

I like to run long distances, backpack, bake sourdough, do yoga, lift things, watch Starcraft, play some video games newer than Starcraft, and fret about feeling like I&amp;rsquo;m getting nothing done.

I love taking pictures of Sutro Tower. I think San Francisco is one of the prettiest places on earth.</description></item></channel></rss>
