# alextoombs.github.io

My personal website. No frills, mostly just feel like if I'm burning money on domnains, I may as well host SOMETHING.

## Hugo

This site is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a Go-based static-site generator. If you're interested in hosting your own similar site, you should check out their great [getting started docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

### Hugo theme

I'm using the [m10c](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-m10c/#getting-started) theme for Hugo. Thanks to the author!

## Deployment

This is deployed using Github Pages. You can read about getting that started [at these docs from Hugo](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).
